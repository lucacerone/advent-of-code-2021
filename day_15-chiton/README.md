## Useful Resources

My original solution was working, but it took around 1 min to solve part 1.

I reviewed how Dijkstra algorithm works on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 
and on this [Udacity post](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2021/10/implementing-dijkstras-algorithm-in-python.html).

For efficiency using a heap, I followed along [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kachayev/5990802).
